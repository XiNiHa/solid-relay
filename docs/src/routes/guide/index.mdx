# Getting Started

Solid Relay provides SolidJS bindings for Relay, enabling you to use GraphQL with Solid's fine-grained reactivity. This guide will walk you through setting up Solid Relay in different project configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- A GraphQL schema and server
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) installed (required for Relay compiler in watch mode)
- Node.js and your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, or yarn)

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```package-install
solid-relay relay-runtime
```

Install development dependencies:

```package-install-dev
relay-compiler @types/relay-runtime vite-plugin-relay-lite vite-plugin-cjs-interop
```

## Project Setup

### SolidStart

For SolidStart applications, configure your `app.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";
import relay from "vite-plugin-relay-lite";
import { cjsInterop } from "vite-plugin-cjs-interop";

export default defineConfig({
  vite: () => ({
    plugins: [
    	relay(),
      // required since Relay only gets published in CJS
     	cjsInterop({ dependencies: ["relay-runtime"] }),
    ],
  }),
});
```

### Vite

For Vite-based applications, configure your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import solid from 'vite-plugin-solid';
import relay from 'vite-plugin-relay-lite';
import { cjsInterop } from 'vite-plugin-cjs-interop';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    solid(),
    relay(),
    // required since Relay only gets published in CJS
   	cjsInterop({ dependencies: ["relay-runtime"] }),
  ],
});
```

## Relay Configuration

Create a `relay.config.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "src": "./src",
  "schema": "./schema.graphql",
  "exclude": ["**/node_modules/**", "**/__generated__/**"],
  "language": "typescript",
  "eagerEsModules": true
}
```

## Setting Up Relay Environment

Create a Relay environment to configure your GraphQL client:

```typescript
// src/RelayEnvironment.ts
import { Environment, type FetchFunction, Network, RecordSource, Store } from 'relay-runtime';

// Define your fetch function
const fetchFn: FetchFunction = async (params, variables) => {
  const response = await fetch('/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: params.text,
      variables,
    }),
  });

  return await response.json();
}

export function createRelayEnvironment() {
  // Create Relay environment
  return new Environment({
    network: Network.create(fetchFn),
    store: new Store(new RecordSource()),
  });
}
```

## Provider Setup

Wrap your app with the Relay Environment Provider:

```tsx
// src/app.tsx
import { RelayEnvironmentProvider } from 'solid-relay';
import { createRelayEnvironment } from './RelayEnvironment';

function App() {
	const environment = createRelayEnvironment();

  return (
    <RelayEnvironmentProvider environment={environment}>
      {/* Your app components */}
    </RelayEnvironmentProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Solid Relay set up, you can start using its features:

- [Querying Data](/guide/querying) - Learn how to fetch data with GraphQL queries
- [Fragments](/guide/fragments) - Understand fragment composition and masking
- [Mutations](/guide/mutations) - Handle data modifications
- [Pagination](/guide/pagination) - Implement efficient list pagination
- [Subscriptions](/guide/subscriptions) - Work with real-time data

## Important Notes

### Relay Documentation Compatibility

Solid Relay only replaces the React-specific parts of Relay (equivalent to `react-relay`). This means you can use most of the official [Relay documentation](https://relay.dev/docs/) for:

- **Relay Compiler**: Schema definitions, GraphQL syntax, and compilation
- **Relay Runtime**: Store management, network layer, and core concepts
- **GraphQL**: All GraphQL features and best practices

The main difference is in the component-level APIs, which Solid Relay provides as SolidJS primitives instead of React hooks.

### Plugin Choice

This guide uses [`vite-plugin-relay-lite`](https://github.com/cometkim/vite-plugin-relay-lite) instead of `vite-plugin-relay`. The lite version is recommended as it provides:

- Better bundler performance
- Smaller install size
- Better integration with modern build tools
- Automatic codegen with Relay Compiler

If you need additional features not available in the lite version, you can switch to `vite-plugin-relay`, but `vite-plugin-relay-lite` covers most use cases effectively.
