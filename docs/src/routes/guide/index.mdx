# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with `solid-relay`.

## Installation

First, you need to install the necessary packages. `solid-relay` requires `solid-js` and `relay-runtime`.

```bash
npm install solid-relay solid-js relay-runtime
```

You will also need to set up the Relay compiler. The easiest way to do this is to use the `relay-compiler-language-typescript` package.

```bash
npm install --save-dev relay-compiler relay-compiler-language-typescript
```

Next, add a `relay` script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "relay": "relay-compiler"
  }
}
```

And create a `relay.config.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "src": "./src",
  "schema": "./schema.graphql",
  "language": "typescript",
  "artifactDirectory": "./src/__generated__"
}
```

Now you can run the compiler with:

```bash
npm run relay
```

## Setting up the Relay Environment

The Relay Environment is the central piece of Relay. It manages the cache and the network layer. You need to create an environment and provide it to your application.

Here is an example of how to create a basic Relay Environment:

```typescript
// RelayEnvironment.ts
import {
  Environment,
  FetchFunction,
  Network,
  RecordSource,
  Store,
} from "relay-runtime";

const fetchFn: FetchFunction = async (params, variables) => {
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:4000/graphql", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: params.text,
      variables,
    }),
  });

  return response.json();
};

function createRelayEnvironment() {
  return new Environment({
    network: Network.create(fetchFn),
    store: new Store(new RecordSource()),
  });
}

export const RelayEnvironment = createRelayEnvironment();
```

Now you need to provide the environment to your application using the `RelayEnvironmentProvider`.

```tsx
// index.tsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { RelayEnvironmentProvider } from "solid-relay";
import { RelayEnvironment } from "./RelayEnvironment";
import App from "./App";

render(
  () => (
    <RelayEnvironmentProvider environment={RelayEnvironment}>
      <App />
    </RelayEnvironmentProvider>
  ),
  document.getElementById("root")!
);
```

## Basic Usage

Now you can use `solid-relay` to fetch data in your components. Here is a basic example of how to use `createLazyLoadQuery`:

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { Show } from "solid-js";
import { createLazyLoadQuery } from "solid-relay";
import { graphql } from "relay-runtime";
import type { AppQuery } from "./__generated__/AppQuery.graphql";

const App = () => {
  const query = createLazyLoadQuery<AppQuery>(
    graphql`
      query AppQuery {
        viewer {
          login
        }
      }
    `,
    {}
  );

  return (
    <Show when={query()}>
      {(data) => <p>Logged in as: {data().viewer.login}</p>}
    </Show>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This is just a basic example. The following sections will go into more detail about the different features of `solid-relay`.
